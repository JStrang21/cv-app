# Odin Project CV Project

## Goal
This project is intended give me practice using React and making me more familiar with the ideas/syntax of React. I will be focusing on becoming better at using creating and using Class components which I will replace with functional components later in time. The reason for this is to become more familiar with Class components due to their popularity before hooks for functional components were introduced.
